# hello-world

Hello Earthlings!

I've been programming for a few years, but this is my first time on gitHub. I hope it will save me the hassel of emailing files back and forth. However, my school blocks gitHub because our network techies don't understand what it is, so I guess I'll have to wait a bit before my life is made easier.

Time to learn how this place works!
